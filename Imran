👋 Hi, I’m Imran Khan

Machine Learning Engineer | LLM Systems | Recommender Systems | Production ML

I design and build end-to-end machine learning systems — from data and modeling to scalable training, evaluation, and deployment.
With 7+ years in analytics and applied ML, my focus is on real-world, production-grade AI, not toy notebooks.
